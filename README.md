- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a long-time technology enthusiast, a lifetime learner,  a burgeoning entrepreneur, and a software engineer. My passion is solving problems that affect people's day-to-day lives. Primarily this has been in the realm of finance and health-related technology, but I'm sure I'll find something else along the way.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm in the process of writing two books which will remain a mystery until they're close to completion. It's been quite the experience thus far, and I'm liking the direction my writing is heading. The hope is that they will be out by early 2022.
